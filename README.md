# ðŸ™‚ Welcome to the Shunji Railways GitHub Repository
This is one of my projects to add to my ICT portfolio, the website for a fictional railway company called Shunji Railways.
They transport goods and people on the entire planet of Kikoria. Now they need a website, and decided to put the project Open Source on GitHub.
