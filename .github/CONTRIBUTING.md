## List of code principles

Before code is submitted, it has to follow the following code principles, every line (sorry).
Use the checklist issue and bind it to your issue to keep track of the requirements.

### Modular code
1. **DRY** - Repeated code functionality is moved to functions and modules, instead of writing it twice.
2. **Single responsibility** - Functions, variabels and modules should only serve one purpose.
3. **MVC** - Data, styling and logic are seperated in different files.
4. **Single point of truth** - A variable may only occur in one place.
5. **Composition over inheritance** - Avoid inherticance and duplication by composing objects and arrays.
6. **Cohesion** - Keep simular functions close to each other.
7. **Information hiding** - Prevent global changes to code by keeping code modular and independant.
8. **Code flow** - Avoid complex logic flows and loops.
9. **LoD** - Modules and functions should not know about the inner works of other modules or functions.
10. **Data scope** - Keep the scope of data as low as possible.

### Readable code
1. **KISS** - Write code in a more simple way instead of compact.
2. **Searchability** - Sort and organize code, and document it so it easy to find.
3. **Consistency** - Code follow consistent naming and format.
4. **Comments** - Comment on code, but only when needed.

### Project maintainability
1. **YAGNI** - Add only features required for the moment, and not for later.
2. **Avoid premature optimization** - Code only what is needed at the moment.
3. **Security** - Prevent security weaknesses in the code early on.
4. **Defensive programming** - Always scan and clean user input.
5. **Galls law** - Complex systems are build up from working simple systems

## Review process

- ZIP files will be reviewed by project maintainers or contributors.
- Feedback will be provided, and further changes may be requested.
- Once a piece of code is approved, it will be merged into the current project folder for the newest version.

To set up your development enviroment, simply download the corresponding branch and load it into your preferred code editor. Preferred is the usage of:

- Visual Studio - Code editor.
- XAMPP - PHP server.
- Visual Studio DevSense PHP plugin - Important PHP plugin.
- Contentful - Content management system.
