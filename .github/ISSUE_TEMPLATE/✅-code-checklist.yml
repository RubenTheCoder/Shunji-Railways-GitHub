        #### Keep track if your code conforms to our quality here
        <br>
        - [ ] **DRY** - Repeated code functionality is moved to functions and modules, instead of writing it twice.
        - [ ] **Single responsibility** - Functions, variabels and modules should only serve one purpose.
